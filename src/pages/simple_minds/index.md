Of course I have to post one the second of making this blog. Just testing how it handles multiple posts.

# Jamming to 80s rock.

## Simple minds
I recently found Simple Minds - a band from scotland, I think? Well they have this soft-rock kind of vibe, but this one song they have really gives some Dire Straits vibes for me and I, can't emphasize this enough, Love Dire Straits.

## The Cars
Its kind of a SIMPLE name for a band, haha yes, jokes. I also "randomly" found this band.
They have a really good ballad - Drive.
Same kind of soft-rock vibe, but less Dire Straity. Still good though.
