I had to do it to em. 
Well anyway here is the first post to my bog of a blog.

<!-- end -->

# Intro
My flatmate gave me the idea to do a blog. So now I am running a react template blog on github pages for now, I hope. More content will arrive soon.

# How its made? (Discovery Channel vibes)

I googled "react blog template" and got to this link

> <a>https://dev.to/davidepacilio/35-free-react-templates-and-themes-32ci</a>

Where I found this template.

Next I tried to install it, but I ran into a few problems. First of all

# Dude wheres my packages? (Node vibes)

Through trial and error I found that for this template running gatsby the best setup is the following:

```
nvm install 10.13.0

npm install --global gatsby@2.0.31
```

After that it seems to work.

Welp. thats it for now.
